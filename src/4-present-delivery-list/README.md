# Christmas Present Delivery Addresses

[a conversation in the North Pole kitchenette on the morning of December 4th between Santa and the head elf, Bernard]

[Bernard] This is bullshit, Kris. I've been leading the Elves for 200+ years. Don't you trust that I know what I'm talking about?? WE NEED TO GROW THE TEAM. We're running a skeleton-crew here.

[Santa] Remember, we're like a family here; we all make sacrifices! We're still a startup!

[Bernard] I swear to you. I think if I hear another hussle-culture quip from you.... I think my little elf head will explode.

[Santa] If you can stick to it now and get us through one more year, there will definitely be rewards down the line.

[Bernard] I don't know why I even bothered asking...

Clearly, Bernard is a bit disgruntled. Can you blame him? Alas, there's still more work to do.
Bernard walks away and mutters to himself:

Poor Bernard. Let's help him out.

Today's task is to craft a type (`PresentDeliveryList`) that takes an object type as an input and
then replaces the values at each property with an `Address`. We don't know in advance what
properties will be provided, which is why it needs to be a generic type. Otherwise Bernard would
probably just copy/pasta it to get through the day.
