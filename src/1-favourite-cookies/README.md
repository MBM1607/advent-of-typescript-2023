# Christmas Cookies

It's December 1st! That means it's almost time for the big day! Santa has a preparation
regimen that involves, of course, eating lots of delicious cookies.

Santa's elves have provided Santa an API whereby Santa can submit his favorite cookie
flavors. This year his favorites are:

- `ginger-bread`
- `chocolate-chip`

But the elves have some kind of fancy code-gen build step (built in Rust, of course), so
all Santa needs to do is update the `SantasFavoriteCookies` type to accept either of his
favorite cookies.

Can you help?
