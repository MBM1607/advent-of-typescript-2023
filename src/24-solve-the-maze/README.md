# Santa is stuck

Santa is craving cookies! But Alas, he's stuck in a dense North Polar forest.

Implement `Move` so Santa ('🎅') can find his way to the end of the maze.

As a reward, if Santa escapes the maze, fill it with `DELICIOUS_COOKIES` ('🍪').

Santa can only move through alleys (' ') and not through the trees ('🎄').

## Solving the maze

This challenge is going to be a culmination of all the days that came before.
