# Connect 4, but in TypeScript types

Your goal for this challenge is to implement Connect 4 in TypeScript types.

Each cell in the game can contain `ðŸ”´` or `ðŸŸ¡` or be empty ( ). You're provided with a rough
layout of how to organize the board in the `EmptyBoard` type. The game state is represented by an
object with a `board` property and a `state` property (which keeps track of which player is next up
to play).

## What is Connect 4

In case you haven't played it before: Connect 4 is a game in which the players choose a color and
then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line
of four of one's own tokens.

fun fact: Connect 4 is also known as Connect Four, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four,
Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union

another fun fact: Connect 4 was "solved" by James Allen and Victor Allis (independently from one
another.. like two weeks apart!) in 1988. They couldn't do a full brute-force proof at the time,
but 7 years later John Tromp in the Netherlands did it with a database on a Sun Microsystems and
Silicon Graphics International worksations (for a combined total of 40,000 computation hours!).
