# Is Santa Dyslexic?

[it's early Saturday morning and the team has been working overtime. Santa storms into the factory floor shouting..]

[Santa] Don't you elves take any pride in your work?!?! Others would love to have your job for much less pay! I asked for a simple type that will reverse strings!! How hard is that?!? What do we even pay you for??

[unfortunately, Santa is conveniently forgetting that the `Reverse` type was cut from the sprint
(which... of course... he agreed to)]

[floor manager] Ok. We never got acceptance criteria for that ticket.

[Santa] How difficult is it to understand what Reverse does!?
**'rehsaD'** should be transformed into **'Dasher'**, **'recnaD'** should be transformed into
**'Dancer'**, **'recnarP'** should be transformed into
**'Prancer'**.. DO I NEED TO KEEP GOING?

[floor manager] Well you might be surprised. For example, what should happen to multi-codepoint
unicode characters?

[Santa] What are you on about with all that accessibility stuff again!

[floor manager] Accessibility is important, sir.

[Santa] Look, this is just an MVP. We can add accessibility later. Just get me my `Reverse` type!
I'm having a hard time reading this stuff otherwise!
