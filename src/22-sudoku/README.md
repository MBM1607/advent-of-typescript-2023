# Reindeer Sudoku

Santa's reindeer sure do like to cause trouble! This time they've decided to make a game out of
arranging themselves into a Sudoku board.

Before arranging themselves in this configuration, the reindeer left Santa a foreboding message:

SaNtA.... yOu MuSt ImPleMeNt ThE `Validate`` TyPe To DeTerMinE WhEThEr OuR SuDokU ConFiGuRaTiOn
Is vALid

Oh.. and what's that... also Vixen seems to have left a separate note

make sure `Validate` is a predicate

- Vixen

Well that's sorta condescending. Vixen seems to be assuming we already know that a "predicate"
is just a fancy computer science term for a function that returns `true` or `false`. Oh well.
That's Vixen for you.

## What is Sudoku

If you're not already familiar: Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle.
Here are the basic rules:

- Grid Structure: The game is played on a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids or "regions."
- Number Placement: The objective is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9.
- Row Constraint: Every row must contain each number from 1 to 9 without repeating.
- Column Constraint: Every column must also contain each number from 1 to 9 without repeating.
- Region Constraint: Each of the nine 3x3 regions must contain each number from 1 to 9, again without repetition.

Normally you solve the puzzle by logically deducing the numbers for the empty cells, ensuring that
all rows, columns, and 3x3 regions have numbers from 1 to 9 according to the rules. However,
in this case the cells are all already filled in and your mission is to instead determine whether
the configuration follows the rules of Sudoku.
