# Naughty List Decipher

\[early on the morning of Thursday December 14th, Santa stumbles into office greeted by Bernard,
the head elf..\]

\[Bernard\] YOU'RE A MESS. Were you out partying.. on a WEDNESDAY?? AGAIN??!!!

\[Santa\] It seems as such. Some investors were in town so we went over to the Mistletoe Lounge and
things got a little out of hand.

\[Bernard\] I oughta report you to HR. Seriously. This is getting out of control.

\[Santa\] We're like a family here; no need for formal HR processes!

\[Bernard\] Where's the list for today's naughty kids? We're behind on coal lump production.

\[Santa\] Umm.

\[Bernard\] You're joking. Tell me you're joking. You lost the list again?

\[Santa\] Well, not lost per se.

\[Bernard\] Then where is it?

\[Santa\] I have it.. but I only scribbled down the names real quick with slashes in between them.
