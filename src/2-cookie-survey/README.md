# Christmas Cookie Inventory

Phew! Yesterday's tactic worked. Santa got down-and-dirty with the elves on the factory floor
and they seem to have stopped planning their strike.

With one small exception.. Unfortunately, two pesky elves (Jingle and Jangle) have realized that
the 300 year stock options vesting cliff that Santa put into the elves' contract isn't quite
typical. Jingle and Jangle already joined forces with Hermey (who has nothing to lose because
he'd rather be a dentist than make toys) and they're beginning to cause a fuss.

Santa noticed that a lot of this discussion is happening during cookie inventory. Help Santa
speed up the process so these conversations are cut short.

Take a look at the `cookieInventory` variable in the tests. Your goal is to update
`CookieSurveyInput` so that it will return a union of all of the names of the various
different cookies.

Good luck! As Santa always says: "your hard work will pay off eventually, just be patient".
