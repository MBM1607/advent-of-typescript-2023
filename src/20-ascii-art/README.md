# TypeScript ASCII Art

Your goal for this challenge is to take an input like `Hi` and turn it into ASCII art!

So for example `Hi` would turn into:

```txt
█ █ █
█▀█ █
▀ ▀ █
```

## but there's a twist

You'll also need to handle newlines! Take a look at the tests to see some examples of that in action.

Enjoy!

...wait

....what's that.....

## **!! BREAKING NEWS JUST-IN FROM THE TYPEHERO INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING TEAM !!**

We have just received word that the term "ASCII art" is commonly used to refer to text-based
visual art in general. That means that although characters are not part of the ISO-8859-1
character encoding set, it's still ASCII art! We also just received word that pencil lead has
actually been made of graphite since the 16th century but we all still call it "lead" even though
it's not made from the 82nd atomic element, lead(!!). News, Sports, and Weather at 11.
Back to you Carol.
